# End to End Machine Learning Project

This project implements a machine learning solution using a modular approach. It is organized into various components for easy maintenance and extensibility.

## Directory Structure
- `data/` - Contains raw and processed data.
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for exploration and experiments.
- `src/` - Python modules for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
- `requirements.txt` - List of dependencies.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repo_url>`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the project: `python src/main.py`
